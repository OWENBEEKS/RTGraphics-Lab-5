Lab 5 - Texture Mapping

Objectives
1. To learn how to associate texture coordinates to vertex positions.
2. To understand how to create texture objects using DirectX 11 API.
3. To learn how to specify textures as a shader resource.
4. To understand how different texture sampling technique works.
5. To learn how to create and specify sampling states.
6. To understand how multiple textures can be combined to create different graphics effects.
All the exercises described below can be done directly based on what you have achieved in the lab
on lighting. If you would like to see an example on how to load a texture from a file and use it in the
fragment shader, you can have a look at the Tutorial07 C++ source code from the Tutorial 07 project.
